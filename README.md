# Predicting house prices  

There are several factors that impact the overall price of the house, some of those factors are more tangible as the quality of the house or the overall size (area) of the house and other factors are more intrinsic such as the performance of the economy. Coming with an accurate model that predicts with such precision the actual value is an arduous task since there are both internal and external factors that will affect the price of a single house. Nevertheless, what we can do is detect those features that carry a heavier weight on the overall output (Price of the house).  
In order to perform an extensive analysis of this data we should explore our data, this means getting a sense of what is the story behind the data.

In this project we will go through several steps of data science process:  
1. Frame the problem  
2. Obtaining data  
3. Data processing  
4. Exploratory data analysis (Visualizations)  
5. Perform in-depth data analysis


We chose this topic for the project because we have personal interest in it, in the last 6 months we are searching for a house to buy, and we could really use a model to predict the price of a house so we could buy it before its price goes up.
